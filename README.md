🌾 Revolutionizing Agriculture: ML & DL for Crop Quality and Weed Control

🧠 Abstract

This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** to improve crop quality and control weeds efficiently. Weeds reduce productivity and harm the environment when treated with uniform spraying. Using **YOLOv8m**, **SVM**, **Random Forest**, and **ANN** on benchmark datasets (**CottonWeedID15**, **EarlyCrop-Weed**), we achieved up to **99.5% accuracy** in weed detection and classification.

Our hybrid approach—combining **statistical features (GLCM, LBP, Hu Moments)** and **deep architectures (VGG, DenseNet, ConvNeXt)**—offers a sustainable, high-accuracy, and cost-effective solution for smart agriculture.

⚙️ Proposed System

* Annotated **CottonWeedID15** dataset for precise weed labeling.
* **U²Net** used for background removal.
* Comparative study of ML and DL models for optimal weed detection.
* Promotes awareness of DL adoption in agriculture.

Advantages:
✅ High accuracy (>88%) on both datasets.
✅ Feature-rich ML and DL integration.
✅ Eco-friendly and scalable weed control.
